About
=====
This documentation is provided for use with the Airframe Finite Element
Modeler (AFEM) program developed by Laughlin Research, LLC.

Technology Stack
================
The AFEM core technology stack includes:

* `OpenCASCADE <https://www.opencascade.com>`_: This mature library provides
  advanced geometric modeling and CAD functionality and is under active
  development.

* `Netgen <https://sourceforge.net/projects/netgen-mesher>`_: This library
  enables advanced meshing capabilities including 3-D tetrahedral and 2-D
  unstructured quad-dominated surface meshing.

* `Salome Platform <http://www.salome-platform.org>`_: The core meshing library
  from this open source application serves as the central component for
  AFEM's mesh generation capabilities.

* `pyOCCT <https://github.com/LaughlinResearch/pyOCCT>`_: This open source
  project provides Python bindings to the OpenCASCADE and Salome Platform
  meshing libraries.
